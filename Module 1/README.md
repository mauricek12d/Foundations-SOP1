# Module 1: Movie Review Page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This project is part of Module 1 of the Full Stack Foundations SOP. The goal was to build a basic, interactive movie review webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” focusing on foundational front-end skills.

I created a movie review experience featuring the films **Inception**, **Insomnia**, and **Memento**, with a layout that includes a homepage, contact page, multiple review pages, and a user input form with validation.
