        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>Directed by Christopher Nolan, Inception is about the character Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</p>
